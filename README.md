A Zipline project from [Free Code Camp](http://www.freecodecamp.com) that is live on [My CodePen](http://codepen.io/natac13/full/ZbOWpV)

I was trying out testing with Jasmine and Karma with this project. I also used created my own filters to use which I learned how to test as well. 
This project is also my first attempt at trying to be more organized with the code base itself. I am trying to create simple modules that do one thing and then I am seeing how it becomes easy to test when the code gets set up this way.
